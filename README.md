# Aimee-PythonRE

A discord bot created for general use and entertainment purposes.
VERY anime oriented. Uses AI to generate responses to user questions when mentioned (WIP)

Current Features:
- Aimee will respond to your messages (and should remember you) in DMs as well as servers when mentioned (All with her own personality). Using ChatGPT API for responses and Pinecone's vector database for memory.
- Most communities I am apart of play the MMORPG 'Final Fantasy XIV', so Aimee is able to display a character's lodestone information as long as that character exists. Can also access game info using XIVAPI.
- Music using locally hosted Wavelink server. (WIP, trying to find non locally hosted solution.)
- TTS using Elevenlabs' API. Aimee will speak text given to her and clearly say who initiated the command so that you always know who's talking to you :) (Not working now, looking for another option.)
